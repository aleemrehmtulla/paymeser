# Ser, Ser. Pay Me 🙏

## What is this?

Think cash-app link meets crypto. Why type in such a long address, when you can just let them know your SerTag! No need to go in a wallet to create a transaction. We do that for you :)

## Usage 🤝

1. Claim your sertag & create a profile
2. Copy your SerLink
3. Send it to a fren and get monies :)

If they have an account: `paymeser.vercel.app/aleem`

If they have an ENS, but no account: `paymeser.vercel.app/aleemr.eth`

If they don't have either: `paymeser.vercel.app/0x1F9b9034Ee1665D554F120D0e41E66455a04C367`

You can also add `?USD=500` or `?ETH=0.5` to any to set a pre-value. Ex. `paymeser.vercel.app/aleemr.eth?USD=500`

## Deployments 💻

### Important notes

This was a 1.3 day project. I know it's not perfect :-)

Undecided to work on it more- I do however beleive it *can* be a valuable tool. Imagine a query param with a non-registered eth address worked! Or you could link a social media to proove it's really your address!

I used ChakraUI & Supabase for this- fork it and have some fun 🍴
